(defun num-to-list (n)
    (loop for c across (write-to-string n) collect (digit-char-p c))

(defun palindrome ()
    (setq res 0)
    (setq tmp 0)
    (loop for p from 1 to 1000 do
        (loop for q from 1 to p do
            (if (equal (num-to-list (* p q)) (reverse (num-to-list (* p q))))
                (setq tmp (* p q))
                (if (> tmp res) (setq res tmp))
